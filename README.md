# A Personal Guide to CTFs
After completing my first ever CTF I realised I had picked up a lot of tips and tricks that I may not remember if I don't write them down. I also realised a lot of stuff I found online, I had to figure out what it was even saying. This is a place to record useful knowledge I pick up in a format that suits me.

## Reverse Image Searching

When reverse image searching, perhaps to find where a photo was taken, try picking out distincive features and cropping the image when searching to only that feature. This helps focus the results.

## CyberChef

[CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) is an amazing tool for rapidly decoding or decrypting data. It can even do all the heavy lifting for you sometimes if you use the "Magic Operation" in Favourites. It is worth running anything encoded through CyberChef to see if it can crack it for you.
